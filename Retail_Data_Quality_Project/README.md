# Retail Data Quality & Reporting Analysis

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end analytics process starting from raw datasets and ending with validated insights presented in a Power BI dashboard.

---

## Purpose of project
This repository serves as a portfolio example demonstrating a full analytics lifecycle - starting from raw datasets, ensuring their quality, and ultimately producing business-ready reporting in Power BI.

## SQL-based Data Quality Analysis
Located here: [README.md](sql/README.md)

Includes:
- profiling of raw datasets
- error classification
- reconciliation checks between two sources
- creation of final reporting-ready output tables
- screenshots illustrating execution results

---

## Power BI Dashboard
Located here: [README.md](dashboard/README.md)

You can open the interactive report directly via the PBIX file:  
[dashboard.pbix](dashboard/dashboard.pbix)

Includes:
- KPI visualization
- customer and product metrics
- trend analysis
- interactive slicing by date/product/customer
- technical documentation
